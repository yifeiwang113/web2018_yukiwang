1. Artists excel at creating worlds, so how does Artistâ€™s abstract thinking improve web world? 
2. How could a website complement what you already do rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?
3. Can website brings inspiration to artists?

my favorite quote in this article: 
Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.</div>
