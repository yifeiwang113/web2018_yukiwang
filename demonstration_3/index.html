			<h1>Frank Ocean</h1>
 			<h2>The Artist is Absent</h2>
            <p>Last month Frank Ocean’s album Blonde was certified platinum, breaking one million units sold in an age when nobody seems to be paying for music. But the psychedelic future soul of Frank Ocean has always been about meaning, not numbers. For 032c Issue 33 (Winter 2017/18), music journalist Alex Needham got to the heart of Blonde in “The Artist is Absent,” a feature accompanied by a photo editorial shot by Petra Collins and styled by Mel Ottenberg. The print edition is still available at our online store. <a href="https://032c.com/frank-ocean-the-artist-is-absent-2">original link</a></p>
