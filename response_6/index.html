        <h1>A Note on the Type</h1>
        <div>
        1. How does meta fonts make TeX more complete? <br/><br/>

The quote I really like in the reading:  “you  are  trying  to  build  a  bridge  over  a  rather  tumultuous  river.  Let’s  say  that  one  bank  of  this  river  is  the  “social”  and  the  other,  far  away,  inaccessible,  separated  by  a  violent  current,  by  many  eddies  and  dangerous  rapids,  is  the  “natural.”  Now  suppose  that,  instead  of  trying  to  cross  this  river  and  build  this  bridge,  you  decide  instead  to  go  wIth  the  fLow,  that  is,  to  get  involved  in  a  bit  of  canoeing,  kayaking  or  rafting.  then  the  absence  of  a  bridge  is  not  such  a  problem. ” <br/><br/>
In my opinion, if a road does not work, we can have different ideas to create another way. Life is also like this. <br/><br/>

2. In the article says: indeed you can “meta” just about anything, do you agree or disagree?<br/><br/>

( disagree with it, I think meta in computer or in font can change, because meta font is a magic main element however, science and technology are not all)<br/><br/>

reading summary: I am actually not a Data person, and I am afraid to see data and templates that I do not understand at all, same as this reading, I am still confused after I read twice, once in english, and once I transfer to Chinese. this may be the gap between me and those science students.</div>
