            <li> How does the internet change the lives of today’s artists? 
an artist’s website allows for an inordinate amount of freedom and experimentation to present that work to its best advantage to a wide audience. 
on a personal site any artist can choose to present their work however they choose.
So, internet can give more opportunity to some new artist and not well known artist to show their works.</li>
            
              
            
            <li>the artist’s website is the patchwork result of many different needs, from a digital business card to an online portfolio and digital archive. But could it be more? </li>
