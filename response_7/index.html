Jürg Lehni talks with Philippe Cao & Daniel Giuditta

1. Is people learn something they like from a child faster than teenager?
2. Is science and math are the most important skill for programming auto-didactically? 

the quote I like: “My relationship to code is maybe similar to that of a craftsman to his craft. I see it as a way to form abstract material, and I constantly read on new ways of building things using code.”

3. Is code can also use art to represent? However, can the programmer replace it with an artist?
4. How a machine gesture bring us convenience?

little summary: 
I am actually an Adobe person, I like to use illustrator and photoshop to do a lot of homework. Even I am not a master user, but those apps have brought a lot of convenience to Artist, College student.</div>
