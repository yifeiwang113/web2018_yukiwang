        <div>1. Do you agree or disagree that designer’s job was to shape not to write? is this formation is itself a far-reaching form?
        <br/>
quote that I really like: The  span  of  graphic  design  is  not  a  history  of  concepts  but  of  forms.  Form  has  evolved  dramatically  from  one  year  to  the  next,  and  suggests  a  profession  that  continually  revises  and  reshapes  the  world  through  the  way  it  is  rendered. 2. Why graphic design become more important in today’s society?
